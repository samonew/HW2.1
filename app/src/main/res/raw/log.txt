Problem: I couldn't remember the 'or' operand
Solution: I googled "or in java" and I got a table full of boolean operations

Problem: I couldn't remember how to compare booleans
Solution: I googled "comparing booleans java" and in images found code that showed me to use
        boolean operations instead of .equals() or .compare() like I was trying to use

Problem: I couldn't remember how to make a new array
Solution: I googled "arrays java" and found elementary code that showed that the brackets go after
        the type not after the name of the array.

Problem: I couldn't remember how to copy an array or if there was even a way to copy an array without
        using for loops.
Solution: I googled "copying an array" and found the .copy() method.

Problem: I couldn't figure out how to make the array stop once it found a solution
Solution: I went to Dr. Vegdahl and he suggested using methods instead of a huge nest of loops
        So I wrote methods for making a piece of world, checking that piece against square, and
        making the array mold to the shape

Problem: I couldn't figure out how to make check() understand continuity.
Solution: Went to Dr. Vegdahl and he showed me a way to assign each truth a number then rotate
          through the array until all that had pieces touching were the same.
